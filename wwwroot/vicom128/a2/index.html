            <h2>Extra Curriculars</h2>
                <p>In high school, I wasn't that into sports. However, for the 4 years that I was in high school, I helped work tech for the productions both at our high school and at the middle school nearby. It was a fun experience and I was the person that was always called out of class in order to go help the adults work on a project that only I knew how to do.</p>
