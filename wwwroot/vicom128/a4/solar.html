      <h3 class="p-title">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Solar energy is light from the sun turned into usable energy, this is the most efficient and eco-friendly sources of energy that is currently possible to obtain right now. There are many applications for solar, using it to charge other electronics, chargin batteries for future use, and even using it to power your home and take it completely off the grid. Many people actually hook up solar to their house and then sell energy that the solar panels produce back to the electricity company in order to either, make money, or reduce the cost of electricity in off-seasons such as winter.

      <h3 class="p-title">Commercial Use</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Solar is often used commerically as well, many businesses small or large use solar panels to generate electricity for their building(s). Solar panels may be expensive but if you're planning on staying in the building for a while than it might be worth it based on how much electricity you use and how many you get. Because businesses use a lot of electricity and must have their lights on for the majority of the day, it is a good idea to invest in solar panels to at least cover a little bit of the cost of electricity. This is especially useful for companies with larget buildings.

      <h3 class="p-title">Personal Use</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Many people use solar to power their homes and/or gardens in order to save money on electricity and reduce their carbon footprint. One thing about solar panels is they have to be mounted a certain way and direction in order to work properly, this can get expensiev. The amount of houses with solar panels is increasing, but not at a rate that we would like to see. Another thing about solar panles are they usually can't be moved if the person moves to another house, they are usually just added to the cost of the house instead of being dismantled and transferred.
