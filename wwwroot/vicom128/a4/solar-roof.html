        Tesla's solar roof is still a work in progress but it could be the most efficient and stylish way to produce solar energy

      <h3 class="p-title">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Solar roof is one of Tesla's side projects, it is intended to bring solar energy to many homes while also not ruining the style of the home. The solar roof looks like a normal roof but each shingle is it's own solar panel generating electricity just like a conventional one. The idea is to generate solar while maintaining the look of the home. There are many different styles available and there are probably going to be many more as the production of the panels ramps up. This could be a viable option if you do not like the look of solar panels on your roof but also want the benefits of having solar panels. The most efficient point for a solar panel to be is on the roof of a house, there are some configurations that could be in the backyard of a house in a grid like you would see on massive fields for large business or agricultural use. Tesla has many other projects to work on but this should be coming to mass produciton sometime in the next couple years.

      <h3 class="p-title">How it works</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Not all of the shingles on a roof are individual solar panels, the typical solar roof is about 35% solar panels, they function just like normal solar panels except they just have a protective/styling layer over them in order to preserver the look and the panels themselves, as I said before, there are many different styles for the solar roof that you can choose from depending on how you want your house to look. The one caveat of a solar roof is it is a lot more expensive than a regular solar panel setup for a typcal home.
      </p>
      <h3 class="p-title">Cost:</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The one downside of this option is the cost, to cover the roof of a house needing ~3000sqft of solar roof, and the roof being about 35% solar panels would cost more than $65,000. The average house of that size needing a slate roof would be about $45,000. When you think about it, the cost of upgrading to a solar roof compared to a slate roof isn't as much as you might think, although, a solar roof would require a lot more supervision and upkeep as opposed to a normal slate or asphalt roof.
