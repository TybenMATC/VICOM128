      <h3 class="p-title">What is Tesla?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph" id="2-paragraph1">
        Tesla is an American car company, one of the newest car companies to hit that market. Just because they are brand new doesn't mean they aren't really on the same level as other older ones. They have just recently become the highest valued car compnay in the world, overtaking Ford and GM. Tesla is all about sustainability and innovating technology. They have three models, the Model X (SUV) Model S (Sedan) and the newest Model 3 (Compact Sedan). Although Tesla's cars a really expensive compared to the average consumer car, many people still love them and will buy them to support the brand and the movement for sustainability. All of Tesla's car are fully electric and take no liquids with the exception of brake fluid and windshield washer fluid. All of Tesla's cars are able to support full self-driving capability if optioned. When laws permit, the company will release software that will allow the "driver" to type in an address and the car will drive there without any interaction from the driver.

        The Tesla Model X (Pictured to the Right), it Tesla's one and only SUV, one staple of the Model X is the rear doors go up instead of out, aptly named "Gull-Wing doors". The Tesla Model X starts at about $86,000 USD and is able to seat up to 7 people if optioned. The interior is pretty much the same as the Model S except for the large windshield that goes all the way past the driver and passenger's heads.

      <p class="paragraph" id="2-paragraph3">
