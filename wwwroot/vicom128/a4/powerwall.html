      <h3 class="p-title">What is it?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Tesla's Powerwall&copy; is a way to store excess solar power generated either from their Solar Roof or regular solar panels. This is meant to be stored on a wall in either your garage or your basement, whichever you prefer/the wiring allows. The Powerwall is just a giant battery on the wall that takes in solar power and stores it for nighttime/future use. While you're away at work and your solar panels are hard at work generating electricity, the excess that isn't used is stored in the Powerwall in order to provide energy for the night. It is the ultimate pair to have solar panels and this because it allows you to go compltely off the grid and actually sell whatever electricity you don't use back to the electric company in order to further aid your savings by switching to solar.
      </p>
      <h3 class="p-title">How it works:</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        The solar panels generate energy from sunlight and it is all transformed and stored in the Powerwall. If you didn't have powerwalls, overnight you would have to take energy from the electricity company and still rack up an electricity bill. With Powerwall, you can be on solar power for the entire night, granted you don't do anything that requres an insane amount of energy. The powerwall just acts as a constant generator for your house, supplying power even if the power goes out for everyone else.
      </p>
      <h3 class="p-title">Cost:</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        If your house is on the smaller side, Tesla recommends you buy two powerwalls to support the amount of power usually used during solar downtime based on the size of your house. If you would like to have things such as your air conditioner run during a power outage, they recommend you buy an extra one for redundancy like that. Tesla doesn't actually allow you to get less than two because it would mess up the wiring that is associated with the solar, there is one for general use and one for more storage/redundancy. The cost for 2 Powerwalls is ~$13,400. Although, if you have enough saved for the solar roof, you should be able to scrape up a little more for the Powerwalls and go fully solar.
