      <h3 class="p-title">What is Sustainability?</h3>
      <p class="paragraph" id="s-1">
        Finding ways to maintain the earth's environment is sustainability. There are many ways to sustain the environment, when most people think of it, they think of using electricity instead of burning natrual gas and releasing harmful particles into the atmosphere. Some popular ways to promote sustainability are: buying an eco-friendly vehicle, getting solar panels, and biodiversity. A problem people generally associate with sustainability is global warming, the melting of the polar ice caps. Global warming is a controversial topic as some people don't believe in it. Global warming is also messing with the earth's atmosphere, as we know, there is a big hole in the ozone layer that is getting bigger as we speak.

      <h3 class="p-title">How it helps the environment:</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Encouraging sustainability helps save the environment, by switching to solar you are reducing the amount of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere, eventually, the air will become so dense with chemicals that trees and other fragile plants cannot perform photosynthesis as efficiently. Switching to an eco-friendly vehicle also helps a ton, especially when paired with solar panels. If you buy a full electric vehicle and proceed to charge it using purely solar power, that is probably the most efficent way to promote sustainability.

      <h3 class="p-title">Tesla</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        One company that is the staple of sustainability is <span><a id="tesla-link" href="https://tesla.com">Tesla</a></span>, they create purely electric vehicles and also work on creating solar panels along with batteries to maximize efficiency for "green" energy. Tesla is mostly well-known for their cars, fully electric vehicles that are also filled with modern technology. One of Tesla's vehicles main features is their "autopilot". Autopilot allows the car to essentially drive itself. Although full self-driving capability is not available or legal yet, there is enough software and hardware that the car can drive itself in traffic and even change lanes on the highway.
