        <h2>Is that text really THAT important?</h2>
        <p>There is no text that is worth looking at right away, people who text and drive tend to look at every text or notification that comes their way. There are some apps that you can get to deter notifications while you're driving but most people don't like to use those because they're scared of missing an important notification. The only reason you should be using your phone while driving is to have a GPS to direct you to your destination, if that.</p>

        <h2>In Summary</h2>
        <p>Texting and driving kils a rediculous amount of people every year, there is no reason to be texting and driving or using your phone for that matter. The only legitimate reason for using your phone is for GPS for directions. Don't text and drive</p>
